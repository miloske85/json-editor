#JSON Editor

This is a simple program written in Python (wxPython) that can unserialize and serialize JSON. I wrote it because I need to debug RESTful web applications often and many times I need something more useful than just the network console of the browser. Since there can be sensitive data in the JSON server responses, I don't want to use online services such as jsonlint.com.
